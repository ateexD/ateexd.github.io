I am a computer science undergraduate and a full time research assistant at [Solarillion Foundation](solarillionfoundation.org/research-team/). I graduated from SSN College of Engineering, Chennai in 2017. Currently I am researching on reinforcement learning and working on a movie occupancy prediction engine.
