## [Low Cost Static Gesture Recognition System Using MEMS Acceleromters](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8016217/) 
    * Designed and constructed a glove that recognized static gestures.
    * Developed a light weight algorithm to identify alphabets in American Sign Language.
    * Presented in Global IoT Summit, Geneva, Switzerland.

## Design Optimization of Activity Recognition System on An Embedded Platform
    * Modeled an activity recognition system using just accelerometer data to identify activities.
    * Engineered features to be minimalistic yet effective and worked on 3 datasets.
    * Deployed the above system on Raspberry Pi Zero.
    * To be presented at Future of Information and Communication Conference, Singapore in April 2018.
